# Librarium

This repository contains an Android app written in JAVA to create and manage a personal library. The origin of this project is my passion for books and the goal of having an own library at home. Consequenly, I purchase a lot of books doubting sometimes if I have already purchased a certain version or a certain book.

The app creates a database using SQLite, allowing the user to add new books, edit and delete the existing books and perform a search based based on the database fields (book name, author, type, etc.). The app will include also some statistics such as the total number of books, the author more repeated in our library or the dominant genre. 

## Implemented functionalities
- Create a database using SQLite.
- Add new books
- Edit and delete the existing books

## Next steps
- Perform a search based on the database fields (book name, author, type, etc.)
- Take pictures of the book's covers.
- Store the book's covers pictures in the database.
- Add statistics (number of books, dominant genre or author, etc.)
