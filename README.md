# Librarium

This repository contains an Android app written in JAVA to create and manage a personal library. The origin of this project is my passion for books and the goal of having an own library at home. Consequenly, I purchase a lot of books doubting sometimes if I have already purchased a certain version or a certain book.

The app creates a database using SQLite, allowing the user to add new books, edit and delete the existing books and perform a search based based on the database fields (book name, author, type, etc.). The app will include also some statistics such as the total number of books, the author more repeated in our library or the dominant genre. 

## Screenshots of the current version
